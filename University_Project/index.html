<P> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp  The University of Houston Downtown (UHD) is a four-year state university, 
and is one of four public universities within the University of Houston System. Its campus spans 20 acres (8.1 ha) 
in Downtown Houston, with a satellite location in northwestern Harris County.[4] Founded in 1974, UHD is the 
second-largest university in the Houston area with nearly 14,000 students. </p>

<p> &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In 1992, Max Castillo came from San Antonio College to lead the university. During the 1990s, UHD focused on 
becoming a metropolitan university appealing to traditional students as well as working professionals. During the 
early 1990s, UHD also began key partnerships with community colleges and it moved to meet greater Houston's demand 
for qualified teachers when it added a teacher certification program in urban education. During this time, the Weekend 
College Program began and a new Academic Building and the Jesse H. Jones Student Life Center opened. </p>
