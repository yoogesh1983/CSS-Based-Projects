#How to run live-server
########################
=> Install live-server :  npm install live-server -g
=> Run live-server : live-server

Note: npm run dev sometimes may hang on. in this case, you may need to change 'dev' with 'compile:sass' and run the command 'npm run compile:sass'. Now once this runs successfully, you may change back it to 'dev' from then onwards it starts work on 'npm run dev' too. Bug!!

Note: You can run this project directly at Visual-Code live-server (Bypassing the above live-server installation step)
