# What is the Application all about ?
- This is a Css Application that uses SASS as a css compiler </br>
- This application helps you to better learn how to code Css Using Sass </br>

# What to compile and run the application ?
> npm run dev </br>

&nbsp; - Upon running this command will create style.css under the 'public/owner' folder. However sometimes the command may hangs on while runnig this command. in this case, you may need to change 'dev' with 'compile:sass' in package.json and run the command 'npm run compile:sass'. Now once this runs successfully, you may change back it to 'dev' from then onwards it starts work on 'npm run dev' too. Bug!! </br>

&nbsp; - You can now run this project directly at Visual-Code live-server (Bypassing the below live-server installation step) </br>
> npm install live-server -g </br>
> live-server </br>
